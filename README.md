# Batch Gradient Descent on Bike-sharing dataset
Implementation of the Batch Gradient Descent algorithm from scratch.


Implementaton of the Batch Gradient Descent algorithm on the Bike Sharing Dataset available in the UCI repository
• First of all, read about the dataset, its features, and identify the target that should be predicted. These are all provided in the dataset repository.
• I only considered the ’hours.csv’ file in the data folder. Also, used the first 80% of the data to train your model, and test on the last 20% of the data.
• 
• I normalized the data.
